Hi .I have a doubt in circular imports .This is the link where I have uploaded 3 files (main.js , lib1.js ,lib2.js) https://github.com/aadhar54/WebClarity

(main.js)
In line 1 of main.js , I am able to understand that it requires lib1 file so we go to lib1.js .

(lib1.js)
-hello gets printed
-line 2 of lib1.js requires lib2.js so we go to lib2.js

(lib2.js)
-hi gets printed
-line requires lib1 but acc to rule when one file is under process of require , {} is returned , thus lib1 ={} 
-bi gets printed
-{} jhum gets printed
-{b:20 , lib1:{}} is returned to lib1.js

(lib1.js)
-at line 2 ,lib2 is assiged as {b:20 , lib1:{}}
-bello gets printed
-{a:10,{b:20 , lib1:{}}} is returned to main.js

(main.js)
-const lib1 gets value as {a:10,{b:20 , lib1:{}}}
which is correct and this only gets printed 


MY DOUBT IS WITH THE SECOND LINE OF main.js 
as neither the control is going to lib2 as hi is not printed .
I am unable to understand how in line 2 value of lib2 is stored as 
{ b: 20, lib1: {} }
Why does it not even print hi which is at the beginning of lib2.js as if control will go to the file to require it , it should print that .Please help me .THanks for patience .

Total output of main.js is :
hello
hi
bi
{} jhum
bello
{ a: 10, lib2: { b: 20, lib1: {} } }
{ b: 20, lib1: {} }
